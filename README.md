# Kidney Stone Detection Web App

This Streamlit web application predicts whether an individual is diagnosed with kidney stones based on certain health-related features. It utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to make predictions.

## Model

- **Model Type**: Not specified in the script
- **Model File**: model.joblib
- **Model Loading Path**: C:/salman/ML/kidny stone/model.joblib

## Project Structure

- **README.md**: Documentation of the project.
- **main.py**: Streamlit web application for making kidney stone predictions.
- **model.joblib**: Pre-trained machine learning model for kidney stone prediction.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd kidney-stone-detection-web-app

## Usage
-Clone this repository to your local machine.

-Ensure you have the pre-trained machine learning model ('model.joblib') in the same directory as the script ('main.py').

-Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

-Run the Streamlit web application:`streamlit run main.py`

-Enter the required health-related features in the web interface to get predictions.
## Model Training
The project uses a machine learning model to classify individuals into two classes: diagnosed with kidney stones and not diagnosed with kidney stones. The pre-trained model is saved as 'model.joblib'.

## Future Improvements
There are several ways to improve the model and the web application:

-Specify the type of machine learning model used in the script.

-Fine-tune hyperparameters for better model performance.

-Gather more labeled data for improved accuracy.
